# Document Similarity Calculator

This project is a web application that calculates the similarity and dissimilarity between a human-written text document and various AI-generated documents. It utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and similarity measures such as Cosine Similarity and Jaccard Similarity to provide insights into the textual content.

## Features

- Upload PDF files for human-written and AI-generated documents.
- Calculate similarity using Cosine Similarity or Jaccard Similarity.
- View results in a user-friendly interface.
- Display TF-IDF matrix for detailed analysis of word importance.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python.
- scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python that provides tools for data mining and data analysis.
- PyPDF2: A library for reading PDF files in Python.
- Pandas: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computing in Python.
- NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit for working with human language data.
